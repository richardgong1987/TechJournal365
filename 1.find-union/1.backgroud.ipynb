    "# Union Find / Disjoint Set Union (DSU),\n",
    "\n",
    "**Union Find**, also known as **Disjoint Set Union (DSU)**, is a data structure used to keep track of elements that are partitioned into a number of **disjoint (non-overlapping) sets**. It supports two main operations efficiently:\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Core Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Find(x)**:  \n",
    "  Determines the **representative (or root)** of the set that element `x` belongs to. This helps check whether two elements are in the same set.\n",
    "  \n",
    "2. **Union(x, y)**:  \n",
    "  Merges the sets containing `x` and `y` into one set.\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Real-World Analogy\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a group of people forming **friend circles**. Initially, everyone is alone. As people make friends (`union(x, y)`), their circles merge. To check if two people are in the same circle (`find(x) == find(y)`), we trace their chain of friends.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Data Structure Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically uses an **array** or a **map** to represent the parent of each element. Two optimizations make it very fast:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Path Compression** (during `find`) — flattens the structure for faster future lookups.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Union by Rank / Size** — always attach the smaller tree to the larger one to keep depth shallow."
